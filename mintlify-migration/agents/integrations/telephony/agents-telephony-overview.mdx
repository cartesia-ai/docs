The platform automatically provisions a phone number for each Agent when you promote to production.. When agent is deleted,
the assigned phone number is released and cannot be re-assigned to another Agent.

When you make dials with a Cartesia managed phone number, a telephony cost of $0.014/minute is pass through onto your
Agent usage.

<Note> Bringing your own phone number or CCaaS provider is on the short term roadmap </Note>
