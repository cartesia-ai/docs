# State
Only deployments in the `ready` state can handle inbound or outbound calls. At any time, only one deployment is active.
Deployments that fail health checks will not receive traffic.

# Creating a deployment
You can use the CLI deploy command or push to a GitHub repository linked to an Agent to create a new deployment for an Agent.

When we receive a new deployment, Cartesia servers will perform the following:

1. Build the virtual environment

**Pre-Call Initialization**

Inbound calls will ring for five seconds to allow your application logic to warm up any required resources and establish
    connections.
