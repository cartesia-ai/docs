## Voice

You can set your Agent's voice directly in the playground. Note that if you make changes to your Agent's voice settings
in your code, this will override the settings from the playground when a call is made.

## Background Audio

You can set your Agent's background audio directly in the playground. You can also use this page to upload, delete & 
preview your background sound files. Note that if you make changes to your Agent's background sound settings in your code, 
this will override the settings from the playground when a call is made.

### Audio Comparison

Listen to the difference between an agent with and without background sound:

<Columns cols={2}>
<div>
#### With Background Sound

<AudioPlayer src="/assets/audio/agents/agent_with_background_sound_sample.mp3" >
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</AudioPlayer>
</div>
<div>
#### Without Background Sound

<AudioPlayer src="/assets/audio/agents/agent_without_background_sound_sample.wav">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</AudioPlayer>
</div>
</Columns>


## Environment Variables

Environment variables are securely added via the console per Agent so you don't need to upload them in your code base.
