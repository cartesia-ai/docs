# Features

## Initialize a Project
Link any directory to a new or existing Cartesia agent:

```zsh lines
cartesia init
```

Create a project from a template:

```zsh lines
cartesia create
```

<Tip>
    When are you working inside a project directory, the CLI will automatically detect the agent.
    You can skip passing `--agent-id` argument.

    
    Run `cartesia status` to see the current agent id.
</Tip>

## Chat with Your Agent
Test the text reasoning logic for your voice agent locally.

Terminal 1. Run your text logic fastapi server:
```zsh lines
PORT=8000 uv run python main.py
```

Terminal 2. Run the CLI to chat with your agent:
```zsh lines
cartesia chat 8000
```


# Commands 
## Authentication

To get an API key, go to [play.cartesia.ai/keys](https://play.cartesia.ai/keys), select your organization, and generate a new key.

```zsh lines
cartesia auth login
```

To validate the existing API key:
```zsh lines
cartesia auth status
```

To logout (clears cached credentials):

```zsh lines
cartesia auth logout
```

## Voice Agents

Deploy your agent to Cartesia cloud.

```zsh lines
cartesia deploy
```

List out all the agents in your organization:

```zsh lines
cartesia agents ls
```

### Deployments
Deployments are versions of your agent running on Cartesia's cloud.
When we receive a new deployment, cartesia servers will rebuild the virtual environment, instantiate your project, and perform a health check to ensure it is ready to receive calls.

To see all of your deployments:
```zsh lines
cartesia deployments ls
```

Check the status of a deployment:
```zsh lines
cartesia status [<deployment-id> or <agent-id>]
```

## Environment Variables
Create, list, and remove environment variables for your agent.

Set environment variables for your agent:
```zsh lines
cartesia env set API_KEY=FOOBAR MY_CONFIG=FOOBAZ
```

<Warning icon="lock">
    Environment variables are encrypted for storage and can only be accessed by your code.
</Warning>

Port environment variables from a `.env` file:
```zsh lines
cartesia env set --from .env
```

```zsh lines
cat .env
API_KEY=FOOBAR
MY_CONFIG=FOOBAZ
```

Remove an environment variable:
```zsh lines
cartesia env rm <env-var-name>
```
