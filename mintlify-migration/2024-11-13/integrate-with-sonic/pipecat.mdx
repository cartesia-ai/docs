Pipecat is a framework for building conversational agents. Cartesia provides both Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) services for Pipecat through our [official integration](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat/tree/main/src/pipecat/services/cartesia).

Many of Pipecat's foundational examples are built on Cartesia's WebSocket API, which makes them a great starting point:
