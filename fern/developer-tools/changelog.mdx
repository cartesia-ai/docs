Updates to existing APIs for `sonic-2-2025-04-16`

Starting with `sonic-2-2025-04-16`, we're removing support for:

- Embeddings
- `stability` cloning mode
- Experimental controls for adjusting speed and emotion.

In our latest models, the `similarity` cloning mode is dramatically better than `stability` cloning,
and we've solved the stability issues, so it's no longer worth using `stability` mode at all.

The experimental controls for speed and emotion negatively affect model stability, we've found.
We're working on releasing these features in future model versions in a way that is more
controllable and stable.

To use these features stably with the new model, we recommend using instant voice cloning to create
new voices with the modifications you're looking for. For example, you can speed up or slow down
voices with `FFMPEG`, use Voice Changer to create emotive versions of voices, and make instant
clones of voices generated with embeddings on `sonic-2-2025-03-07`.

If you still need these features, please use `sonic-2-2025-03-07` as the model ID for the previous
version of the model and `2024-11-13` for the previous version of the API. Please be aware that
these features could lead to reduced model stability even with that model.

Specific API changes:

- `sonic-2` and `sonic-2-2025-03-07` will ignore experimental controls used with TTS generations
- Voice cloning only supports `similarity` clones -- this technique performs the best across-the-board on the `sonic-2` model.
- Removed embeddings from all endpoints.
- Voices may only be specified by Voice ID
  - `/tts` generations cannot be called with voice embeddings
- Deprecated `/voices/create` and `/voices/mix`
