# Changelog

## Version 2025-04-16

### New Features

**New authentication**

Check `API Conventions` and `Authenticate your app` pages for more info.

- Deprecated `X-API-Key`. Authorization is expected to be via the `Authorization: Bearer {apiKey}` or `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header in HTTP request.
- Support client-facing authentication using `/access-token` to generate temporary tokens without exposing your API key

### Updates to existing APIs

- Experimental controls are not compatible with `sonic-2` voices and are not supported in TTS generations
- Voice cloning only supports `similarity` clones -- this technique performs the best across-the-board on the `sonic-2` model.
- Removed `embeddings` from all endpoints.
  - `/tts` generations cannot be called with voice embeddings
  - Voices may only be specified by Voice ID
  - Deprecated `/voices/create` and `/voices/mix`
