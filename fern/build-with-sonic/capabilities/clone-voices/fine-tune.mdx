The **Voice Fine-Tuning** feature is available to Scale and Enterprise users through the [Playground](https://play.cartesia.ai). It trains a custom model directly on your audio to create **Fine-Tuned Voices**.

## Pricing & Access Model

| Stage | Cost | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Fine-Tune Request | 3M Characters | One-time fee charged per fine-tune request |
| Voice Unlock | 27M Characters | One-time fee per voice to enable API access |

When a **Fine-Tune Request** completes, you'll receive **5** variations of your cloned voice. Initially, these voices are "locked" - meaning you can test them in the Playground but cannot access them via API. This allows you to thoroughly test each variation before committing to the ones you want to use at scale. Once you've identified the best performing variation(s) for your use case, you can unlock them for API access.

<Warning>
  **Locked Voices will be deleted after 30 days if not unlocked!**

## Creating Fine-Tuned Voices

Let's walk through the process of creating a **Fine-Tuned Voice** using our `Sarah` voice as an example.

To start, navigate to the [Voice Fine-Tuning](https://play.cartesia.ai/clone/requests) page in the Playground and click the **Request** button.

From there, fill out the **Request a Fine-Tune** form with the Name, Description, and Language for your voice. Make sure you have consent from the original speaker to create a clone of their voice. Only English is supported at this time.

Afterwards, you'll be directed to the **Fine-Tune Request** page with a **Files** tab where you can upload the audio files associated with your voice. Here are some best practices for recording your audio:

- Generally, more audio leads to a better fine-tuned voice.
- We recommend uploading at least **30 minutes of audio** for the best results.
- All audio files should be from the same speaker.
- Large file uploads can be slow. Try breaking your audio up into multiple files to speed up the upload process.

Click the **Train** button to start the training process after uploading your all of your audio files. This will take between 2-8 hours to complete depending on the amount of audio you uploaded. The cost of training is **3 Million Characters** and will be charged once training has completed successfully.

Once the training is complete, you'll see **5** versions of your new voice in the **Created Voices** tab. All versions will also be available in the [Voice Library](https://play.cartesia.ai/library) along with your other voices. Each version is associated with a set of fine tuning parameters automatically selected based on the source audio.

You'll have access to all voices via the Playground, but API access will be locked. To unlock, click the Lock icon next to each voice. There is a one time cost of **27 Million Characters** per voice you unlock.

<Warning>
  **Locked Voices will be deleted after 30 days if not Unlocked!**
