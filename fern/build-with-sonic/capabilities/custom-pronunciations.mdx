When using Sonic (whether through the playground or API) you can directly add Sonic-flavored IPA phonemes in the transcript.

Wrap phonemes in `<<>>` and append each phoneme with a pipe `|`.

## Usage example

`Can I <<g|ˈɛ|t|>> <<h|ɑː|l|ˈə|p|eɪ|n|y|ˌoʊ|>> on that?` will be pronounced as `Can I get jalapeño on that?`

## Sonic-flavored IPA

We've compiled a pronunciation guide for the style of IPA that works most effectively with Sonic.

<Note>
Our model follows the [English phonology article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English\_phonology) for most phonemes, but in spots where our model requires different notation than you may expect, we've included a blue `<=` in the margins.
</Note>

You can copy/paste some of these uncommon symbols from the original [charts here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OJbiKtxLyodpNPqVfOu43X2HloLsAixTtFppEuQ\_4pI/edit?usp=sharing).

## Stresses and vowel length markers

Our model requires stress markers for first (`ˈ`) and second (`ˌ`) stressed syllables, which go directly before the vowel. We also use annotations for vowel length (`ː`). The model can also operate without them, but you will have noticeably better robustness and control when using them.
