In many real-time use cases, you don't have input text available upfrontâ€”like when you're generating it on the fly using a language model. For these cases, Sonic supports input streaming through a feature we call _continuations_.

## What are continuations?

Continuations are generations that extend already generated speech. They're called continuations because you're continuing the generation from where the last one left off, maintaining the _prosody_ of the previous generation.

<Note>
Prosody refers to the rhythm, intonation, and stress in speech. It's what makes speech flow naturally and sound human-like.
</Note>

## Why use continuations?

> **TL;DR:** If you don't use continuations, you get sudden changes in prosody that create seams in the audio.

Let's say we're trying to generate speech for the following transcript: `Hello, my name is Sonic. It's very nice to meet you.`. However, we don't have the full transcript available upfront. Instead, we get it in three parts:

1. `Hello, my name is Sonic.`
2. `It's very nice`
3. `to meet you.`

To generate speech for the whole transcript, we might think to generate speech for each part independently and stitch the audios together:

Unfortunately, we end up with speech that has sudden changes in prosody and strange pacing:

Now, let's try the same transcripts, but using continuations. The setup looks like this:

<Frame caption="Figure 2: Generate transcripts using continuations." background="subtle">

</Frame>

Here's what we get:

As you can hear, this output sounds seamless and natural.

You can scale up continuations to any number of inputs. There is no limit.

## Caveat: Word-by-word or token-by-token inputs

> **TL;DR:** If you want to stream the input in word-by-word, your code should buffer the first sentence of the input upfront. Then you can stream the remaining input text word-by-word.

Let's try the following transcripts with continuations: `['Hello, my name is Sonic.', "It's ", 'very ', 'nice ', 'to ', 'meet ', 'you.']`

<Warning>
Note that the one word transcripts each have a space after them if they don't have a punctuation.
