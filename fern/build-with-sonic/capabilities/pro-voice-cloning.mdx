Pro Voice Cloning is available through the [Playground](https://play.cartesia.ai) only. It uses the [Fine-Tune](https://play.cartesia.ai/clone/requests) feature to train a custom model directly on your audio.

Let's walk through the process of creating an Pro Voice Clone using our `Sarah` voice as an example.

To start, navigate to the Fine-Tune page in the Playground and click the **Request** button.

From there, fill out the **Request a Fine-Tune** form with the Name, Description, and Language for your voice. (Note: only English is supported at this time.)

Afterwards, you'll be directed to the **Fine Tune Request** page with a **Files** tab where you can upload the audio files associated with your voice. Here are some best practices for recording your audio:

- Generally, the more audio you upload, the better the quality of your clone.
- We recommend uploading at least **30 minutes of audio** for the best results.
- All audio files should be from the same speaker.
- Large file uploads can be slow. Try breaking your audio up into multiple files to speed up the upload process.

Click the **Train** button to start the training process after uploading your all of your audio files. This will take between 2-8 hours to complete depending on the amount of audio you uploaded. The cost of training is **3 Million Characters** and will be charged once training has completed successfully.

Once the training is complete, you'll see **5** versions of your new voice in the **Created Voices** tab. All versions will also be available in the [Voice Library](https://play.cartesia.ai/library) along with your other voices.

Each version is associated with a set of fine tuning parameters automatically selected based on the source audio. Feel free to try them out in the Playground, but API access will be locked. Please reach out to [Sales Support](https://play.cartesia.ai/support) to request API access.
