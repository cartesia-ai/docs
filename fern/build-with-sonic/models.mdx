### Continuous updates

`sonic` and `sonic-preview` are aliases for the latest stable and preview models. We recommend using these for prototyping and development, then switching to a date-versioned model for production use cases to ensure stability.

## Sonic

_Sonic_ is our flagship text-to-speech model. It produces high-accuracy, expressive speech, and is optimized for efficiency to achieve low latency.

- **Model alias:** `sonic`
- **Release date:** Dec 2024
- **Latest version:** `sonic-2024-12-12`

To learn how to use Sonic, see [Make an API request](/get-started/make-an-api-request).


## Sonic Preview

Sonic Preview is our latest preview snapshot. It is updated regularly, and may not be as stable as `sonic`. Use `sonic-preview` to see the latest features and research direction from Cartesia.

The latest version of `sonic-preview` demonstrates superior transcript following, especially for dates, long numbers, and phone numbers.

- **Model alias:** `sonic-preview`
- **Supported languages:** en

## Legacy Models

### Sonic English (deprecated)

_Sonic English_ is our original English text-to-speech model. While it is still supported in our API, we recommend using the `sonic` model instead.

- **Latest version:** Oct 2024
- **Supported languages:** English

**Capabilities:**

* Supports abbreviations, acronyms, initialisms and phonemes (alpha).
* Supports numbers, dates, phone numbers and SSNs.

**Known issues:**

* Audio generations can loop or diverge on transcripts that have repeated words in succession.
* Audio generations may occasionally sound fast.
* Some long numbers and phone numbers may sound rushed as well.

### Sonic Multilingual (deprecated)

_Sonic Multilingual_ was the first multilingual Sonic variant, with improved transcript following and low latency.  While it is still supported in our API, we recommend using the `sonic` model instead.

- **Model ID:** `sonic-multilingual`
- **Release date:** Jun 2024
- **Latest version:** Sept 2024

**Supported languages:**

**Capabilities:**

**Known issues:**
- Some inaccuracies in numbers, dates, and phone numbers in Japanese and Portuguese.
- Audio generations may occasionally sound fast.


**Recommendations:**

* It is recommended to use voices from the same language as the transcript for the best performance.
