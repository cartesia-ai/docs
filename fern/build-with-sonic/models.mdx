Cartesia provides a family of state-of-the-art models, including our highly-accurate, low-latency Sonic TTS model family.

- <span style="color: green;">●</span> the latest **stable** snapshot of the model
- <span style="color: orange;">●</span> the **preview** snapshot (if available)

To use the stable version of the model, we recommend using the base model name (e.g. `sonic-2`).
In many cases the stable and preview snapshots are the same, but in some cases the preview snapshot may have additional features or improvements.

## `sonic-2`

Sonic-2 is the new and improved version of s
Like its predecessor, it produces high-accuracy, expressive speech, and is optimized for efficiency to achieve low latency.

Capabilities:
- Higher fidelity voice cloning 
- Timestamps for all 15 languages
- Infill support 

| Snapshot | Release Date | Languages | Status |

## `sonic-turbo`

All the power of Sonic, with half the latency (as low as 40ms).

## `sonic`

The first version of our flagship text-to-speech model. It produces high-accuracy, expressive speech, and is optimized for efficiency to achieve low latency.

| Snapshot | Release Date | Languages | Status |
|----------|--------------|-----------|--------|
| <span style="color: green;">●</span><span style="color: orange;">●</span> `sonic-2024-12-12` | December 12, 2024 | en, fr, de, es, pt, zh, ja, hi, it, ko, nl, pl, ru, sv, tr | Stable |
| `sonic-2024-10-19` | October 19, 2024 | en, fr, de, es, pt, zh, ja, hi, it, ko, nl, pl, ru, sv, tr | |

## Selecting a Model

When making API calls, you can specify either:

```javascript
// Use the base model (automatically routes to the latest snapshot)
const model = "sonic-2";

// Or specify a particular snapshot for consistency
const model = "sonic-2-2025-03-07";
```

### Continuous updates

All models have a base model name (e.g. `sonic-2`, `sonic-turbo`, `sonic`).
We recommend using these for prototyping and development, then switching to a date-versioned model for production use cases to ensure stability.
