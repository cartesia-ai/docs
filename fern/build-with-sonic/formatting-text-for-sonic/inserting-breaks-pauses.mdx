title: Inserting Breaks/Pauses
---

To insert breaks (or pauses) in generated speech, you can use `<break />` tags. For example, `<break time="1s" />`. You can specify the time in seconds (`s`) or milliseconds (`ms`).

## Example

```xml
Hello, my name is Sonic. <break time="1s"/> Nice to meet you.
```
