title: Spell Out Input Text
---

To spell out input text, you can wrap it in `<spell>` tags.

This is particularly useful for pronouncing long numbers or identifiers, such as credit card numbers, phone numbers, or unique IDs.

## Example

```xml
My phone number is <spell>(123) 456-7890</spell> and my credit card is <spell>1234-5678-9012-3456</spell>.
```
