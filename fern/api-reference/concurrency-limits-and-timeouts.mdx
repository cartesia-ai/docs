  Learn about concurrency limits and timeouts with the Cartesia API.

We measure concurrency in terms of the number of unique contexts active at a given time. For WebSockets, each `context_id` corresponds to a unique context; additional messages you send with the same `context_id` will not count against your concurrency limit. For regular HTTP endpoints, each HTTP request corresponds to a context.

If you exceed your concurrency limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` error. You can check your concurrency limit and upgrade it on the playground at [play.cartesia.ai](https://play.cartesia.ai).

## Interpreting concurrency limits

How you interpret your concurrency limit depends on how you're using Sonic.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Conversational use cases">
    For real-time conversational use cases, such as powering voice agents, we've found that the number of parallel conversations you can support is effectively 4X your concurrency limit. This is just a rule of thumb, and depends on the types of conversations you're supporting. You can reach out to us to discuss your specific use case.

    For example, if you have a concurrency limit of 15, you can typically support 60 parallel conversations.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Non-conversational use cases">

    For non-conversational use cases, such as generating speech in batch jobs, there is a more direct relationship between your concurrency limit and the number of parallel generations you can support.

  For example, if you have a concurrency limit of 15, you can typically support 15 parallel generations. You can use a connection pool to ensure you don't exceed your concurrency limit.

## WebSocket timeouts

We close idle WebSocket connections after 5 minutes. If you need to keep a connection open for longer, you can periodically do a generation to keep the connection from idling.
