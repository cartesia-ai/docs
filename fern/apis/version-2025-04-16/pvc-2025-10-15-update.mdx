## Why use Pro Voice Cloning?

A Professional Voice Clone (PVC) is a voice that uses a fine-tune of our TTS model on your data, which allows it to create an almost exact replica of the voice it hears including accent, speaking style, and audio quality.

Compared to Instant Cloning, Pro Voice Cloning can capture the exact nuances of your hours of studio-quality audio voice data.

## Overview

Pro Voice Cloning is available in the [Playground](https://play.cartesia.ai/pro-voice-cloning) for anyone with a Cartesia subscription of Startup or higher. It allows you to create highly accurate voice clones by leveraging a larger amount of data compared to instant cloning.

### Pricing

| Feature                  | Cost                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Training                 | 1M credits on success     |
| PVC Voice Text-to-Speech | 1.5 credits per character |

We'll first fine-tune a model on your data, then create Voices from selected clips of your data. These Voices are tied to the fine-tuned model and will be automatically routed to it for TTS generation.

## Get started

Visit the Pro Voice Clone tab to get started on your first PVC. In the home page, you will be able to see all your fine-tuned models and their statuses (i.e Draft, Failed, Training, Completed).

    ### Prepare Data
    Fill out the form with the requested info for the Voices you are about to create.

    Then, upload all of the audio files you want to use for training. You can upload multiple
    files at once. Files must be one of the following audio formats:

    - .wav
    - .mp3
    - .flac
    - .ogg
    - .oga
    - .ogx
    - .aac
    - .wma
    - .m4a
    - .opus
    - .ac3
    - .webm

    We recommend uploading a minimum of 30 minutes of audio, but around 2 hours of audio is ideal. The Pro Voice Clone will closely match your uploaded data, so make sure it sounds the way you like in terms of background noise, loudness, and speech quality.
    Generally, it's ideal to upload audio with only the speaker you which to clone. Multi-speaker audio can interfere with the cloning quality.

    If you also reused data from past Pro Voice Clones. Switch to the **Select dataset** tab to view previous datasets. These datasets can be edited separately from your PVCs and are helpful for managing your audio files.

    ### Train Model

    Training should take 3 hours to complete. You'll only be charged if the training is successful. If training fails, you can click the `Re-attempt Training` button to try again or contact support if the failures persist.


    ### Test Voices

    Once training is complete, we'll automatically create 4 Voices based on different source audio clips from your dataset. These Voices are internally linked to your fine-tuned model, which will be used when you specify the model ID of the fine-tuned model in your requests.

    The Voices are also available in the Voice Library under My Voices and can be used through the API.

    **Note about base model updates:**

    We've fine-tuned the latest base model available in production, which is reflected in the displayed model id. This means that the fine-tuned model is fixed to this particular model ID and will not be activated if you use a different model-id. PVCs will not automatically be updated for future base models, and will need to be retrained on each new base model.
    Retraining a new fine-tuned model with new data or the latest base model will again cost 1M credits.
