subtitle: Learn how to create higher fidelity voice clones by leveraging more of your data.

Professional Voice Cloning is available in the [playground](https://play.cartesia.ai/pro-voice-cloning) for select enterprise tier users. It allows you to create voice clones from a larger amount of data compared to instant cloning.

We'll first fine-tune a model on your data, then create Voices from selected clips of your data. These Voices are tied to the fine-tuned model and will be automatically routed to it for TTS generation.

Click on the `Create` button to get started.

## PVC Workflow

<Steps>
    ### 1. Prepare Data

    Provide a **Name** and **Description** for your voice model. Select the **Language** of your audio data.

    </Frame>

    Next, you'll create a dataset. Upload your audio files using the **Upload samples** button or by dragging them onto the designated area. Alternatively, use the **Record audio** function to capture audio directly. Aim for 30 minutes to 2 hours of high-quality audio for optimal results.

    The interface will show the total duration of the uploaded audio.

    ### 2. Train Model

    Before training, you must verify your voice by reading a short consent statement aloud. Use similar recording conditions to your training samples for reliable verification.

    Click the **Train Pro Voice Clone** button to start the fine-tuning process. Training time depends on the amount of data submitted. You can monitor the progress in your **Voices** inventory and will be notified upon completion.

    ### 3. Test Voices

    Once training is complete, several Voices derived from clips of your data will appear, linked to your fine-tuned model.

    Select a Voice and use the text box and **Speak** button to test its generation quality. You can specify the `model_id` of your fine-tuned model when using the API or playground to generate speech with these voices.
