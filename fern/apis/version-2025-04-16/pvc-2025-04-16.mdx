## Overview

Professional Voice Cloning is available in the [playground](https://play.cartesia.ai/pro-voice-cloning) for select enterprise tier users. It allows you to create voice clones from a larger amount of data compared to instant cloning.

We'll first fine-tune a model on your data, then create Voices from selected clips of your data. These Voices are tied to the fine-tuned model and will be automatically routed to it for TTS generation.

Click on the `Create` button to get started.

## PVC Workflow

<Steps>
    ### Prepare Data

    Fill out the form with the requested info for the Voices you are about to create.

    Next, you'll create a dataset to upload your audio data. Click the `Create Dataset` button to initialize a new dataset.

    </Frame>

    Then, upload all of the audio files you want to use for training using the `Upload samples` button or by dragging them onto the designated area. You can upload multiple files at once. Files can be in any standard audio format.

    We recommend uploading a minimum of 30 minutes of audio, but around 2 hours of audio is ideal.

    Accept the disclaimer and click the `Train Pro Voice Clone` button to kick off training.

    ### Train Model

    Training should take up to 1 hour to complete. You'll only be charged if the training is successful. If training fails, you can click the `Retry` button to try again or contact support if the failures persist.

    ### Test Voices

    Once training is complete, we'll automatically create 4 Voices based on different source audio clips from your dataset. These Voices are internally linked to your fine-tuned model, which will be used when you specify the  model id or alias listed below in your requests.

    The Voices are also available in your Library and can be used through the API.
