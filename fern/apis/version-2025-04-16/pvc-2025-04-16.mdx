subtitle: Learn how to create higher fidelity voice clones by leveraging more of your data.
---

Professional Voice Cloning is available in the [playground](https://play.cartesia.ai/pro-voice-cloning) for select enterprise tier users. It allows you to create voice clones from a larger amount of data compared to instant cloning.

We'll first fine-tune a model on your data, then create Voices from selected clips of your data. These Voices are tied to the fine-tuned model and will be automatically routed to it for TTS generation.

## Step-by-Step Process

<Steps>
    ### Access the Professional Voice Cloning Feature

    Within the Cartesia playground, go to the **Voices** area. Click **Add Voice**, then opt for **Professional Voice Clone**.

    ### Supply Your Audio Data

    Add your audio files using the **Upload samples** button or by dragging files onto the designated area.

    </Frame>

    Alternatively, if you lack pre-existing recordings, utilize the **Record audio** function to capture audio directly. Crafting a script that reflects your desired vocal style is advisable.

    ### Review Audio Duration Feedback

    After uploading, the interface displays the cumulative duration of your provided audio. Achieving optimal fidelity typically requires a minimum of 30 minutes of high-caliber audio, with 1-2 hours being the ideal range.

    ### Complete Voice Verification

    Prior to submission, you'll need to verify your voice by reading a brief statement aloud. This step confirms your consent for cloning. For reliable verification, aim to use recording conditions (equipment, room, tone) similar to your training samples.

    ### Await Training Completion

    Your custom voice requires processing before it's usable. Monitor the training progress in your **Voices** inventory. You will receive a notification upon completion. The duration of training depends on the volume of submitted data.

    ### Utilize Your Cloned Voice

    Once the training finishes, locate your new voice in the **Voices** list. Select **Use** to begin generating speech with it, either within the playground or through API calls.

## Recommendations for Superior Clones

Professional Voice Cloning technology mirrors the input audio's qualities, including flaws like noise. Adhere to these guidelines for the best outcomes:

<Steps>
  ### Prioritize High-Quality Recordings

  The final clone's fidelity is directly linked to the input audio's quality. Subpar recordings containing ambient noise, echo, or other sonic defects will degrade the clone. Employ the highest quality recording methods accessible to you.

### Isolate the Speaker

Submit audio samples featuring only the target voice. The presence of other speakers, music, or substantial ambient sound can confuse the AI model, resulting in diminished cloning accuracy.

### Furnish Ample Audio Data

Although 30 minutes serves as a baseline, supplying 1-2 hours of audio generally produces markedly better results. A larger volume of clean, consistent data enables the creation of a more precise and adaptable voice clone.

### Maintain Stylistic Consistency

The vocal delivery style (e.g., storytelling, conversational, animated) present in your source audio will be carried over to the clone. Ensure your training recordings align with the intended application's vocal style. Avoid mixing significantly different delivery styles within the training set.

### Record in the Intended Language

For optimal pronunciation and intonation, provide training recordings primarily in the language you plan to generate. While Cartesia's models handle multiple languages, generating speech in a language different from the training data might introduce an accent or slight mispronunciations. Verify that your recording language is supported by Cartesia.

## Helpful Hints and Suggestions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Recording Gear">
    #### Recording Gear

    Employ the best microphone and audio interface you have access to. Although any clear recording can suffice, professional-grade equipment (e.g., an XLR mic connected to an interface) used in a controlled acoustic space is advised for top-tier results. Better input yields better output.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Employ a Pop Shield">
    #### Employ a Pop Shield

    Using a pop filter helps reduce harsh plosive consonants (like "p" and "b"), which can create distracting pops in the audio.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mic Placement">
    #### Mic Placement

    Keep a steady distance between the speaker and the microphone (a common guideline is 6-12 inches, roughly two fist-widths). Getting too close can cause unnatural bassiness (proximity effect), while being too distant increases the capture of room reflections.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Quiet Recording Location">
    #### Quiet Recording Location

    Select a recording space with minimal ambient sound (HVAC, outside traffic, computer noise) and limited echo or reverberation. Acoustic panels or makeshift solutions like thick blankets can absorb sound reflections.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Audio Preparation">
    #### Audio Preparation

    Edit your recordings before uploading. Excise extended silences, frequent filler sounds ("uh," "um"), coughs, and other extraneous noises. Normalize volume levels across different recordings. Enhancing clarity and consistency in the source material benefits the final clone.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Audio Levels">
    #### Audio Levels

    Record at consistent volume levels, ensuring the signal is strong enough for clarity without causing digital clipping (distortion). A common target is to have average levels between -18dBFS and -12dBFS, with peak levels not surpassing -3dBFS.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Data Volume and File Management">
    #### Data Volume and File Management

    Submit a minimum of 30 minutes, and preferably 1-2 hours, of high-standard audio. The overall duration is more crucial than the file count. For extensive recordings (like audiobooks), consider segmenting them into smaller files (e.g., 15-30 minutes each) to simplify the upload and processing stages.
