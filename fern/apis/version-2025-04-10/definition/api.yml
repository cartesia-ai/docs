    docs: |
      We now support authorization either through API Key or Access Token. 
      The API Key can be passed in the `Authorization` header directly. 
      The Access Token should be passed in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token, e.g. `Bearer <token>`.
      (Note: Access Tokens are only accepted for `/tts` endpoints at this time.)
