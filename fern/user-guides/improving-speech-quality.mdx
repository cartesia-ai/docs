The tricks shown below are specific to the current models (`sonic-english` and `sonic-multilingual`), and may change in the future as we improve our modeling and training procedure.

## Text-to-speech

Here are a few guidelines to achieve the best performance:

1. Add punctuation where appropriate and at the end of each transcript whenever possible.
2. Enter dates in MM/DD/YYYY form, such as 04/20/2023.
3. To insert pauses, insert “-” where you need the pause.
4. For the multilingual model, use one of the voices that matches with your desired language for the best results.
5. Use continuations if generating audio that should sound contiguous in separate chunks.
6. Use the [Custom Pronunciation Guide](https://docs.cartesia.ai/user-guides/custom-pronunciation-guide) to insert phonetic transcriptions to ensure correct pronunciation, especially for uncommon words like unique names and chemical compounds or words written the same but pronounced differently, like the city of Nice and the adjective “nice.”
7. Using words instead of digits and using commas to introduce pauses can help phone numbers sound more natural. For example, “650-791-3124” can be input as “six five zero, seven nine one, three one two four.”
8. To emphasize a question, using double question marks instead of a single one can help. (i.e. “Are you here??” vs. “Are you here?”)
9. Avoid using quotation marks in your input text unless you intend to refer to a quote.

## Voice cloning

For the best voice clones, we recommend following these practices in the source clip:

1. **Choose an appropriate transcript to speak.** You want the transcript you record to align as closely as possible with the voice you want to generate. For example, don't read a colorless transcript in a monotone voice unless you're aiming for a monotonous clone. Instead, prepare a transcript that is suited to your use case and has the right energy.
2. **Speak as clearly as possible and avoid background noise.** For example, when recording yourself, try to use a high-quality microphone, be in a quiet space, and so on.
3. **Limit your recording to 10 to 20 seconds.** This is the sweet spot—a longer clip will not result in a better clone.
4. **Avoid long pauses in the clip.** Too many long pauses could result in the cloned voice drifting from the source clip.
5. **Speak in the target language.** For instance, if you want the cloned voice to speak Spanish, speak Spanish in the recording.
