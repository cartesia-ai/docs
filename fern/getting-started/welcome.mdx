Welcome to the Cartesia documentation! Cartesia's mission is to build real time multimodal intelligence for every device. Our current offering includes an API that serves our flagship generative voice model, Sonic.

Sonic is the fastest text-to-speech model aroundâ€”it can generate a second of audio in just 650ms, and it can stream out the first audio chunk in just 135ms. It's capable of instant voice cloning and voice design. Alongside Sonic, we also offer an extensive prebuilt voice library for a variety of use cases.

In this documentation, you'll read about our model, find out how to use our API, and pick up tips and tricks for optimizing performance and quality.
