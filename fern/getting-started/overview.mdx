The Cartesia API currently serves our state-of-the-art multilingual generative voice model, Sonic. Sonic takes text input and and streams back ultra-realistic speech in response. It can also clone voices. You can control every aspect of generations: from speed and emotion to pronunciation and accent.

**Sonic is the world's fastest text-to-speech model.** It can stream out the first byte of audio in just 95ms, making it perfect for real-time and conversational experiences. (To put things into perspective, that's about twice as fast as the blink of an eye.)

**Sonic is the world's highest quality text-to-speech model.** So even if speed isn't your top priority, Sonic is the best choiceâ€”whether you want to narrate content, dub videos, or anything else.

Learn more about available Sonic model variants and their capabilities in the [Models](/getting-started/models) section.
