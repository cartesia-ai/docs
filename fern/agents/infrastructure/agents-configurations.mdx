## Voice

You can set your Agent's voice directly in the playground. Note that if you make changes to your Agent's voice settings
in your code, this will override the settings from the playground when a call is made.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are securely added via the console per Agent so you don't need to upload them in your code base.
