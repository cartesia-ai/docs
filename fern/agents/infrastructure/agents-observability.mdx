Agents built on Line have observability into every deployment and call made.

## Deployment

Each Agent deployment generates unique a deployment id. You can view the logs generated by a given deployment in the console.

## Call Logs

You can click into a call and view any logging statements generated by your reasoning code.

## Transcripts

Each call has a transcript with independently separated transcribed audio and text to be generated. When you export these
transcripts with the API or CLI, these include more granular turn level timestamps.

## Loggable Events

In some scenarios you'll want to record events that occurred within your code without necessarily directly tying them to a Tool Call.
In order to accommodate for this, we introduce the ability to log events generally.

### SDK

In the context of the SDK, we can make any `EventType` a loggable event by registering it with the user bridge.
We can do this in a few different ways, and the serialization will occur automatically depending on whether you're
using Pydantic BaseModel, DataClass, or neither.

```
register_observability_event(bridge, harness, MyBaseModelEvent)  # Uses class name + model_dump()
register_observability_event(bridge, harness, MyDataclassEvent)  # Uses class name + asdict()
register_observability_event(bridge, harness, MyCustomEvent)     # Uses to_log_event() method
```

Post registration, the events will automatically be logged over the websocket when they're broadcast.

### Websocket

If you're not using the SDK and instead just relying on the bare websocket, logging events will look like this:

```
{
  type: "log_event",
  event: "event_name",
  metadata: {
    "key": "value
  }
}
```

### Playground

You can view these events in the Playground under the `Transcript` tab of the call.

## Loggable Metrics

You can also record general metrics at different points in your workflow.

### SDK

In the context of the SDK, we can log a metric by broadcasting the `LogMetric` event.
Here's a snippet from the form filling template that exhibits this:

```
# Record the answer in form manager
success = self.form_manager.record_answer(answer)

if success:
  # Log metric for the answered question
  if current_question:
    metric_name = current_question["id"]
    yield LogMetric(name=metric_name, value=answer)
    logger.info(f"ðŸ“Š Logged metric: {metric_name}={answer}")
```

The user bridge is subscribed to the `LogMetric` event by default, and it will
log it over the websocket by default when it sees that `LogMetric` has been broadcast.

### Websocket

If you're not using the SDK and instead just relying on the bare websocket, logging metrics will look like this:

```
{
  type: "log_metric",
  name: "metric_name",
  value: "metric_value"
}
```

### Playground

You can view these events in the Playground under the `Transcript` tab of the call.

## Call Recordings

Call recordings can be downloaded from the playground.

## Webhooks

A webhook can be sent to a configurable endpoint when a call starts, completes or fails. Each payload includes the full
transcript of the conversation.

</Frame>

In your webhook handler, be sure to verify that all incoming requests have an x-webhook-secret header set to this secret
value, to verify that the requests are coming from Cartesia. A sample payload is listed below.

```json
{
  "type": "call_completed | call_failed | call_started",
  "request_id": "MZ4958bfe4940bf0ef6cc92f8c6cfa1a1f",
  "agent_id": "agent_demo",
  "webhook_id": "agent_webhook_P3MgdLf1cpaucZJ7xWehCC",
  "body": [
    {
      "end_timestamp": 10.387875000000001,
      "role": "assistant",
      "start_timestamp": 1.175,
      "text": "Hi there! I'm Savannah, a voice agent built on Cartesia's new Voice Agents platform. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?",
      "tts_ttfb": 0.20372509956359863
    }
  ],
  "timestamp": "2025-06-24T23:36:40.360473878Z"
}
```
