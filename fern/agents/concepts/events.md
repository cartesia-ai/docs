# Events

Events are Python objects that components use to communicate in the Line SDK.

## What is an Event?

An event is a Python object that carries information between nodes, bridges, and the user.

## Basic Example

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from line.events import UserTranscriptionReceived, AgentResponse

# Built-in events
user_message = UserTranscriptionReceived(content="Hello, how are you?")
agent_reply = AgentResponse(content="I'm doing well, thank you!")

# Custom events
class CustomerInsight(BaseModel):
    customer_id: str
    sentiment: str
    priority_level: str

insight = CustomerInsight(
    customer_id="123",
    sentiment="positive", 
    priority_level="high"
)
```

## Built-in Event Types
For a full list of built-in events and their descriptions, see [line/events.py](https://github.com/cartesia-ai/line/blob/main/line/events.py).
| Category | Events |
|----------|--------|
| <Tooltip tip="Events triggered by user actions during the conversation"><strong>User Events</strong></Tooltip> | `UserTranscriptionReceived`, `UserStartedSpeaking`, `UserStoppedSpeaking` |
| <Tooltip tip="Events generated by your agent in response to user input"><strong>Agent Events</strong></Tooltip> | `AgentResponse`, `AgentStartedSpeaking`, `AgentStoppedSpeaking` |
| <Tooltip tip="Events that control agent behavior and system operations"><strong>System Events</strong></Tooltip> | `ToolCall`, `ToolResult`, `AgentHandoff`, `EndCall` |

Events let components communicate without being tightly coupled. See [Agent Patterns](../agent-patterns/) for examples.

## Defining Custom Event Types
Any object can be an event. This is useful for passing arbitrary data between components.

<Tip>
Use structured classes like [Pydantic BaseModel](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/base_model/) or [Python dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) for your custom events. This provides type safety and validation and makes your code more readable.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class MyEvent(BaseModel):
    field1: str
    field2: int
```
</Tip>

## Messages
Messages are the wrappers around events. They contain the event, but also additional metadata:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `event` | The event object |
| `source` | The node that sent the event |
| `timestamp` | The time the event was sent |

Messages are automatically wrapped in Messages before being sent to the bus.
