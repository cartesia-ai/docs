Templates are pre-built Agents for common use cases developed on the [Line SDK](https://github.com/cartesia-ai/line)
that are easy to extend for your application.

These templates can be cloned into new GitHub repositories by installing the Cartesia app into your
personal or organization account.

    <Step title="Clone your Agent locally">

    Now that your repo is created, let's set up your Agent on your machine.

    ```zsh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Customize your Agent">

    Now that your repo is cloned, you can customize it with specific instructions in the README.md. You can use
        [cartesia chat](/line/cli#chat-with-your-agent) from your CLI to try your changes locally before deploying.
    </Step>


  <Step title="Deploy your changes">
    When you're satisfied with your Agent, pushing to main will trigger a new deployment.
    ```zsh
    git add .
    git commit -m "hello world"
    git push
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check deployment status">
    See your deployment status in the playground or the CLI if you prefer.
