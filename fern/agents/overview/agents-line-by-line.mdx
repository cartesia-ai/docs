title: Text to Agent

You can also build Voice Agents on Line from the playground by simply describing what you want the Agent. You can export the code and
customize it even more.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign into Cartesia Playground ">
    Go to the [Text to Agent](https://play.cartesia.ai/agents/new/text-to-agent) page in the playground.
  </Step>

<Step title="Describe your Agent">
  Enter a description of what you want the Agent to accomplish.

<Step title="Try out candidates">
  After a generation run completes, you can try calling several candidates
  created and pin one to production. This will assign it to a phone number and
  count towards your Agent slots. You can also re-generate a new version of your
  Agent by repeating the steps above.

</Step>

<Step title="Export code to GitHub">
If you want to further customize your Agent, you can export your Agent code to a new GitHub repository,
modify it, and then re-deploy it. Start by connecting your Agent to GitHub in the playground.

  </Step>

    <Step title="Clone your Agent locally">

    Now that your repo is created, let's set up your agent on your machine.

    ```zsh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Customize your Agent">

    Once that your repo is cloned, you can customize it with specific instructions in the README.md. You can use
        [cartesia chat](/line/cli#chat-with-your-agent) from your CLI to try your changes locally before deplowing.
    </Step>

<Step title="Deploy your changes">
  When you're satisfied with your Agent, pushing to main will trigger a new
  deployment. ```zsh git add . git commit -m "hello world" git push ```
</Step>

  <Step title="Check deployment status">
    See your deployment status in the playground or the CLI if you prefer.
