You can connect your Line Agents to GitHub for git-based version control and deployment management.

You can authenticate GitHub into multiple accounts, both personal and across organizations to create repositories. Each
GitHub repository you create is set to private by default.

Once you connect an Agent to a GitHub repository, all deployments to the main branch will trigger an Agent build.
