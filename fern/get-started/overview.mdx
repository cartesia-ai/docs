The Cartesia API serves state-of-the-art generative voice models for both text-to-speech and speech-to-text, enabling developers to build seamless conversational AI experiences.

## Sonic Models for Text-to-Speech

Sonic models transform text into ultra-realistic speech with industry-leading speed and quality. **Sonic 2 streams the first byte of audio in just 90ms**—twice as fast as the blink of an eye—making it perfect for real-time conversations, dubbing, narration, and AI avatars.

**Sonic Turbo** delivers even faster performance at 40ms for applications where real-time responsiveness is critical. Both models support voice cloning with full control over pronunciation and accent across multiple languages.

Learn more about available Sonic model variants and their capabilities in the [Models](/build-with-cartesia/models) section.

## Ink Models for Speech-to-Text

Ink models provide streaming speech-to-text transcription optimized for real-time voice applications. **Ink-Whisper**, our debut model, is specifically engineered for conversational AI—handling telephony artifacts, background noise, accents, and proper nouns that typically challenge standard STT systems.

Ink-Whisper uses advanced dynamic chunking to process variable-length audio segments, reducing errors and hallucinations during pauses or audio gaps. At just $0.13/hour, it's the most affordable streaming STT model available.
